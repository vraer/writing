# About Me

I'm a technical writer based in Los Angeles with a penchant for all things digital.
Read on to learn a bit about my  personal quirks and interests. 

If you're primarily interested in my professional journey, I'd recommend [connecting with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrae/)  or skipping ahead to browse some of my [writing samples](https://vraer.github.io/writing/samples/).

## Fun Facts & Milestones

- **Roots:** First-generation only child with Argentine parents. Though Spanish was my first language, I quickly became fluent in English, thanks in part to 'Barney & Friends'. By the time kindergarten rolled around, I was reading at a fifth-grade level.

- **Tech Beginnings:** At 10, I got my first computer. I spent most of my free time documenting 'The Sims' cheat codes on LiveJournal and navigating the murky waters of LimeWire.

- **Diving Deeper:** By 11, I was writing my first lines of HTML on MySpace. That love for modding grew from aesthetics to functionality, peaking with a discovery of iOS jailbreaking. My tech journey has since expanded to encompass backend/frontend development, UX design, and automation.

- **Problem Solver:** Every situation is a puzzle waiting to be solved, whether it's a complex task at work, an escape room challenge, or a stubborn washing machine at home.

## Mantras

### Just Read the Instructions

I firmly believe that a company's ethos can be gauged by the effort they put into their documentation. My perception of a product is heavily swayed by the quality of its instruction manual.

### Scrappy, Not Crappy

Efficiency is paramount; there's no time for half-measures.
