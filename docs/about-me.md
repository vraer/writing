# About Me

I'm Vanessa, a technical writer based in LA. I love solving complex problems and experimenting with new approaches.

Outside of work, I enjoy podcasts on psychology, collaging weird art, and modding my terminal. I grew up in LA as an only child to Argentinian parents.

## Personality & Work Style

I'm an INTJ personality type. Colleagues often describe me as:

- Approachable and eager to collaborate
- Dedicated to meeting deadlines
- Quick to learn new skills and share knowledge
- Committed to achieving the best results

I have a knack for:

- Developing original content that clarifies complex instructions
- Breaking down complicated topics into easy, step-by-step guides
- Taking initiative to educate myself on new processes and tools
- Embracing new challenges and responsibilities head-on
