#### Problem Statement

From <https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2481#issuecomment-1092100326>:

There are discrepancies in the capitalization of certain words in the menu design for our navigation bar header compared to the menu design for the footer.

- There is a difference in capitalization for the word pitch. Should it be `Submit your pitch` or `Submit your Pitch`?
- There is a difference in capitalization for the word touch. Should it be `Get in touch` or `Get in Touch`?

#### Potential Solution

From <https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2481#issuecomment-1092100326>:
> I think it would make more sense for these navigation menu items to be in title case, which it seems like the footer is already going for. In title case, the two examples you pulled would be “Submit Your Pitch” and “Get in Touch”. I just think it will be easier for us to keep all of the titles/headers/footers/buttons consistent this way, and title case tends to give more symmetry and visual prominence. One way to check if a phrase is in title case is by using <https://capitalizemytitle.com/> . Please let me know what you think! Thanks!

#### Feasibility Determination

The potential solution will not be implemented at this time. So, from <https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2481#issuecomment-1100764836>:
> Decision made by Bonnie: It is going to be "Submit your Pitch" and "Get in Touch"

> After the website homepage launch, research will look into a global change for all the menu items and their corresponding page/section titles.
