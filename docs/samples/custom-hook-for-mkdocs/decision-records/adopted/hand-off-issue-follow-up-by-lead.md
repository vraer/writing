#### Issue

None

#### Problem Statement

How to pass off an issue that needs follow-up by a lead? Also, how to keep track of those issues that need follow-up?

#### Potential Solution

- Add a `ready for [INSERT ROLE] lead` label to the issue, such as `ready for dev lead` or `ready for design lead`
- Then, the respective leads will check the `ready for [INSERT ROLE] lead` for their role and follow up with the issue.

#### Feasibility Determination

This is feasible. Also, it allows a way to pass off an issue that needs follow-up by a lead and it keeps track of issues that still need follow-up by just filtering by the label.
